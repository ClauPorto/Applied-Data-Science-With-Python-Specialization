"single_family","Our homes can be built to 4,500 ft2 McMansion size, but we prefer our 2,680 ft plans. Either way, our HEALING homes look and feel different and our Quality Standards specify how they are healthier. Those standards dictate using non-toxic sustainable building materials like lime plasters and hemp that sequester carbon. It means using all-natural materials like clay plasters and sheepswool to regulate comfort. It means our walls breathe like a second skin - protecting from the elements but allowing water vapor to escape (like sweat leaving the body) so walls dry out and mold never gets going. It means no more virus- and dust-catching metal ducts to heat and cool the home which de-ionize air, dehydrates skin, and exhausts the immune system. It means reducing harmful electromagnetics. And it means creating sleep sanctuaries so our bodies can fully heal each and every night. Our floor plans are designed for modern living with more integrated outdoor spaces, a kitchen always at the center of the home, and an Away Room to more easily accommodate work-from-home activity or house guests. We feature more built-ins to reduce furniture needs and clutter. And we avoid the soul-less big box look of many modern McMansions. Our square footage may be smaller but our homes live larger, more flexibly, and more sustainably while costing less to operate and maintain.

Step inside and feel like you're walking on clouds with brand-new real wood, oak flooring. No more creaky, ancient boards reminding you of yesteryears!

The main level is so spacious with its own primary suite, it's like having your own personal kingdom. Fit a king-size bed, a nursery, and still have room for a walk-in closet that would make Marie Kondo proud.

Right off the kitchen and head to the common roof for the air and water show and other festivities. But wait, there's more (again)! Head downstairs and behold the gas fireplace-your new best friend on chilly Chicago nights. Need some privacy? No problem! With two separate living spaces, you can enjoy your favorite book without interruption, while someone else dominates the gaming realm. Oh, and that downstairs bedroom? It has a den, perfect for toy storage, WFH, or turning into your personal escape pod. The possibilities are endless, just like your imagination. Storage? We've got you covered with ample space inside the unit, complete with newer laundry machines because, let's face it, laundry day needs to be as painless as possible.

"single_family","This charming home was a part of Hyde Park's first planned community, built way back in the 1880s and then known as Rosalie Villas.  To this day, Harper Avenue remains one of Hyde Park's most special and coveted locations.   When the current owners purchased 5724, the house has been in the hands of the same family for the forty-two years.   They then undertook a thoughtful renovation, preserving the character of 19th century details while upgrading the house for modern living.  With new electrical, zoned air conditioning, new hot water heater, water filtration system, new bathroom, new flooring and lighting, and a completion of the entire third level (formerly an unfinished attic) - the house has been beautifully updated.   The large front porch opens into the foyer, where one is immediately impressed with spaciousness.  This is a warm and welcoming house, with an open floor plan that defies its age.  Light fills the living and family rooms; a lovely separate dining room, large kitchen with pantry, breakfast room and powder room complete this level.  The breakfast room opens to a deck that overlooks the lush back yard. Moving up the beautifully detailed staircase, there are four bedrooms that can be used in a variety of ways, and two full baths.  From there one sees a remarkable transformation - the entire third level has been renovated into handsomely finished flexible space.  The open area is accented by two smaller rooms and under the eaves is a charming space to relax. Heading downstairs, the lower level is a work in progress but offers all new windows, storage, a laundry room with new washer/dryer and full size freezer, and the space is plumbed for a full bath.  And the property offers a rarity on the block, a large two-car garage.  Located a short walk from the University of Chicago, the Laboratory Schools and all Hyde Park has to offer.                              And now just a bit of background history.  Remarkably, nearly all of the Queen Anne and shingle-style homes on Harper are still standing nearly a century and a half later.  Years before the founding of the University of Chicago, the development was established by Rosalie Buckingham, a wealthy heiress whose name Chicagoans will likely recognize from Buckingham Fountain in Grant Park, named for Rosalie's cousin. As she neared the age of twenty-five, Rosalie decided to become a property developer in the rapidly expanding Hyde Park Township, which was then still a separate suburb. In 1883, she acquired two city blocks from 57th Street to 59th Street near the Illinois Central tracks and hired Solon S. Beman, who had just designed Chicago's most famous planned community Pullman, to oversee a plan for her land.  Beman provided the overall vision and there were rules that homeowners and other architects had to follow for each of the 42 houses.  This led to the continuity of size and style of homes visible and appreciated to this day. We do not know the architect of 5724 Rosalie Court, but early records list attorney Addison Beardsley as the resident.  All of this is to say .... 5724 Harper is one very special place.","1885","4","3","2","1","2","4512","3500","3","1125000","2022-04-13","1595000","for_sale"

"single_family","The Hutchinson Street Historic District is one of the most cherished enclaves on the north side of Chicago, known for its rich history, storied architecture, lush landscapes, and oversized lots. Rare is the opportunity to own one of its best mansions, the William T. Lake House , sitting quietly yet confidently on a massive 200x117 lot (equal to 1/2 acre in the middle of the city). Built c. 1904, Lake was a prominent corn and grain broker who commissioned a then up-and-coming architect, George W. Maher, to design this 7BR, 5.2BA home in the new and stylish Prairie School style. Maher studied under prolific country home architect Joseph Lyman Silsbee, alongside Frank Lloyd Wright. The Lake House marked the third of five homes Maher designed in the neighborhood. Maher incorporated his two quintessential signatures--his large arched limestone lintels, and a Poppy motif found in many of the original windows, doors, and friezes throughout the home. In Maher's brilliance, the brick color & low roofline were an optical illusion to give the impression the house blended in with the tree trunks--as if to hide in plain sight. 120 years later, the home retains many of its original details and mystique, due to its careful and loving preservation by the current owners for the last 25 years. From the moment you step through the door, the house greets you with an undeniable warmth--like a big hug from a family member. The floor plan follows the lay of the grounds--a grand foyer to the west, followed by large formal living and dining spaces, to the wraparound porch on the east, out to the grounds that comprise the eastern half of the lot. Everywhere you stand in this house, the large windows fill every room with light and views of green landscapes-- letting the outdoors in , and a feeling of space and nature all around you. 5 fireplaces throughout the home add charm & functionality (screens and equipment are excluded from the sale). The kitchen may be on the smaller side for a home of this scale, but every drawer and cabinet serves a well-thought out purpose, and has top-of-the-line appliances. The kitchen also offers many ways it could be laid out for a larger footprint, if one desired. The family room leads to a 2BR/1BA attached coach house, perfect for home offices, or a guest/in-law/au pair suite. Upstairs in the main house the second floor has three large bedrooms plus a library connected to the primary suite. The primary suite has stunning south and east views and sunlight, has two walk-in closets, and a large primary bathroom with dual vanities. On the third level are three comfortably situated bedrooms, sitting & luggage rooms, and a full bath. Downstairs in the basement is a perfectly laid out rec room space including a home theatre with a drop-down projector screen, billiards area w/a fireplace, massive laundry room/scullery, two powder rooms, and tons of storage space. A long, heated driveway leading to the 2 car garage makes winters and guest parking easier! Professionally landscaped grounds and pergolas were designed by Hoerr Schaudt Landscape architects, and offers a park-like setting. Plenty of space for parties, and one spot would be a great place for a pool if one desired. PIN #'s are still separate, if one decided to sell off the side lot for redevelopment. Close proximity to schools: Chicago City Day, Lycee Francais, Sacred Heart, Bernard Zell Anshe Emet, Waldorf, and Disney Magnet. The house sits in the middle of Buena Park, known for Good Living By the Lake . Lakefront bike path and beach access is at the end of the street, plus a plethora of public transit options (CTA 146 & 148 express buses are within two blocks, several other CTA bus and train options nearby). Two blocks to Jewel, Target, Aldi. Bar on Buena & The Reservoir are neighborhood hot spots. Easy access to Lake Shore Drive in less than 3 mins. The Lake House is a once in a generation opportunity few have gotten to enjoy, and it awaits its next owner!","1904","7","7","5","2","2","23479","10709","3","1500000","1999-08-05","3249000","for_sale"

"single_family","A sophisticated presence, landmark status, architectural integrity, and an unprecedented outdoor footprint for Wicker Park, 1407 N. Hoyne Ave. is a one-of-a-kind opportunity for the homeowner who wants an expansive city estate with pedigree and a modern program. Originally built for beer baron John H. Rapp in 1886, this 8250 SqFt-square-foot, 5+ bed/5.5 bath single-family home underwent a 2-plus-year renovation and restoration by Rugo Raff Architects. The current owner acquired and reunited the original 2000 square foot coach house with this lovingly restored home which is now included in this offering. Preserving elements of its Victorian charm while optimizing sightlines and integrating first-class finishes was paramount. This special home's unheard of 98' x 150' lot - a combined oversized 4-5 city lots! - affords multiple green spaces, including a deep front yard with mature landscaping, a side yard with raised garden beds and a European-style pergola, and a meticulously manicured backyard. Inside, an elegant entry plus an oval-shaped entry hall link to a lovely living room with an abundance of natural light, a traditional turret, and a wood-burning fireplace, and a formal dining room just beyond with hand-scraped walnut floors. The custom chef's kitchen stuns with O'Brien Harris cabinetry, white quartzite countertops, professional-grade Wolf/Sub-Zero appliances, an herb garden, a full butler's pantry, a breakfast dining space with banquette seating, and a built-in desk. The main level also features an intimate family room with built-in walnut cabinetry and a chic beverage center, and two beautiful limestone terraces accessed via French doors: a 12' x 23' west terrace for open-air entertaining and a 12' x 17' side terrace that's perfectly appointed for large-scale alfresco dining with an outdoor kitchen and a built-in grill. A striking example of this home's flawless interior architecture is the centrally located, curving suspended staircase. The second level is devoted to two secondary bedrooms (one with custom bunk beds), the first of two laundry rooms, and an impressively spacious primary suite with a sitting area, a custom dressing room, a walk-in closet, and a marble-clad ensuite bath with two vanities, a soaking tub, and a deluxe shower. The third floor presents two designer offices--a handsome den with knotty alder wood floors and a gas fireplace, a cozy den with a wet bar, an exercise room, and yet another polished guest bedroom. But there's more... This truly magnificent home also comes complete with a fully finished garden level with a massive playroom that opens onto a basement terrace, a wine room, a kitchenette, another large guest bedroom with den perfect for related living, a second laundry room, a walk-in storage room, and a custom mudroom that connects to a two-car garage. Plus, the property features a standalone coach house - a wonderful blank slate that can be transformed into a guest cottage, a recreation or art space, offices, or added parking if needed. Additional callout details and amenities include restored original doors and hardware, custom woodwork and trim throughout, designer lighting and wallcoverings throughout, four total fireplaces, 97 Marvin windows, geothermal heating and cooling plus radiant heat in the lower level playroom, a Lutron lighting system, self-irrigating planters on both terraces, and an excess of custom interior storage.

"single_family","At the time this home was constructed there were only four houses on the 4800 block of Greenwood Avenue; Kenwood was then a bucolic suburban retreat.  The catalysts fostering the growth of the neighborhood (the founding of the University of Chicago and the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition) were years away.  For a century and a half this home has stood proudly as the world evolved around it - a new century dawned (twice) and houses by architectural innovators including Frank Lloyd Wright and Burnham & Root rose nearby.  A resurgence occurred as the community was landmarked, and a neighbor elected president.    And through it all 4849 endured.    The ambience of those earlier years remains: a handsome staircase, leaded windows, high ceilings, warming fireplaces and a verdant yard. This welcoming, spacious home offers a layout that can be reconceived for the 21st century, including space for a large kitchen and family room.  With six bedrooms, four full and one-half baths, enclosed porches and lovely formal rooms on the main level, this house provides ample space indoors, and out.  Hyde Park and Kenwood are vibrant communities - enhanced by the University of Chicago, adjacent to the city's magnificent lakefront and located a mere ten-minute drive from the Loop. This is an amazing opportunity to write the next chapter of this home's enduring legacy.","1887","6","5","4","1",,"8040","3519","3","340000","1987-09-24","1350000","for_sale"

"single_family","Rich in scale, history and presentation, this prewar duplex penthouse in the Gold Coast is in a real estate echelon all its own. Perched atop the luxe co-op residences at 1500 N. Lake Shore Dr., encompassing the entire 24th and 25th floors overlooking Lake Michigan, this spectacular residence boasts 8, 000 sq ft of interior living space and 5, 000 sq ft of private outdoor space, including a massive, east-facing terrace with a lawn, manicured gardens, a Roman fountain, and fabulous city and lake views. The building itself is a Chicago institution. Built in 1927 and designed by New York architect Rosario Candela with Chicago firm McNally & Quinn, the building has been home to many prominent Chicago families over the years. The penthouse, however, was built especially for the building's original owner, and has rarely changed hands in the last century. World-class, artisan details like stained glass windows, stone friezes, hand-carved wood doors, and original bronze hardware are found throughout, beginning with a private entry foyer that connects to a 39'-long, walnut-paneled gallery hall with vaulted, hand-frescoed ceilings. The living and entertaining footprint on the main level features a formal dining room, a showpiece living room, a handsome bar/lounge, two offices, a modern chef's kitchen, and three amazing terraces. The living room stuns with 20'-high, coffered ceilings, and a stone fireplace, and affords access to both the yard and the north terrace. The kitchen flaunts custom cabinetry, professional grade appliances, a marble-topped island and counters, and an informal dining area. Four of the home's bedrooms currently live on the main level as well, each with its own unique footprint and architectural details. There's also a spacious, lake-facing room with its own private patio with lounge and fire pit, two generous closets, and a custom, marble-clad en-suite bath that could serve as a stunning primary suite or an epic family room. The home's original limestone staircases have been beautifully preserved, and lead to the second level via three access points. Here, a sixth en-suite bedroom, a sauna room, and more flexible space reside. Plus, there's a partial third floor with a game room/bar and additional storage spaces. White-glove building amenities include a full-time door staff, an on-site manager, and a live-in engineer. This property includes valet parking and pets are welcome. With pedigree and proximity to Lincoln Park, the lakefront, and the best of Chicago's first-class dining and shopping, the penthouse at 1500 N.

"single_family","Built in 1951, this modernist icon, was one of 12 individual houses designed by Bertrand Goldberg, an architect best known for his Marina City and River City projects downtown Chicago. Goldberg's inspiration was Le Corbusier's project for Dom-Ino house from 1914-15. Open floor plan modular structure pioneered by Le Corbusier is at the core of Goldberg's spectacular design. Four cylindrical columns at the corners of the building support three concrete slabs for the floors and roof.  This house's dramatic suspended staircase extends the full height of the building and adds to its airy quality. Helstein House, named after Ralph and Rachel Helstein who commissioned it, was always meant to stand out. Built in a back of a large property, its geometric form, constructed out of concrete with three levels of expansive, light-filled space, was an ultimate departure from traditional American home design.Over the years the house went through some alterations but it didn't lose its original character. The home's present owners closed off the outdoor terrace designed by Goldberg and created a fabulous library/family room connected to the outside garden through oversized windows. The ground level includes a full size bathroom, laundry, storage room and added by the present sellers a 2 car garage. Goldberg's design placed the traditionally main floor living space on the second level with huge living/dining room spanning two floors on one side while three bedrooms and one full bath are on the other side of the staircase. 2022-23 renovation made this space even more flowing by opening the galley kitchen to the two story dining area. The top floor is a loft style space with a partially open bedroom, sitting room/office, large dressing/closet space area and a newly renovated bathroom. The present owners respected the original design which can be easily altered to give more privacy.    This unique house sits in the back of an unusually large parcel, with big front and side yards. Next to the attached garage there is additional parking space for two cars on which one can build a second two-car garage (the city already gave the permit once) .  Living among trees, hearing birds one can forget that this fabulous house is located in the heart of Hyde Park, walking distance to Lab School and UChicago but also, just 20 minutes away from downtown Chicago.","1951","4","3","3",,"2","6750","3324","3","629000","2000-07-07","1685000","for_sale"
